AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:
TIMER
* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
- add event listener on the start button
- start from 70 seconds
- needs show of the corner of the page  
- If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

QUESTIONS
- Start button to take you to the first question
- store questions, choice and correct answer
- options for if it's right or wrong 
- print if the answer is right or wrong 
- after two seconds display the next question 
- at the end display score and ask for initials 
- save the score (time) + initials in the local storage 


- activate the time in the corner to start counting when the first question appears



 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.



  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
