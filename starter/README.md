# Christy's Coding Quiz

## INTRODUCTION

This is a short quiz designed to help students of this course practice what they have learnt in the lesson. The quiz loops through the questions before printing the final score at the end and promting the user to input their initials. Unforunately I could not get the sumbit button to work so these do not log to the local storage and the high score page doesn't load. 

## USER STORY
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS 
- When a user clicks the start button the questions and timer are displayed.
- When they answer a question correctly the next question will be displayed.
- When they answer a question incorrectly 15 seconds is taken from the timer. 
- When all the questions have been answered they are asked to submit their initials.
- Their initials and score are logged to local storage and the highscores page.
