# Christy's Coding Quiz

## Description

This is a short quiz designed to help students of this course practice what they have learnt in the lesson. The quiz loops through the questions before printing the final score at the end and promting the user to input their initials. Unforunately I could not get the sumbit button to work so these do not log to the local storage and the high score page doesn't load.
